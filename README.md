# Welcome to Making Sense's UX Development Challenge!

Young Padawan,

The idea behind this project is, mainly, to help us identify your strengths so we can create an accurate career path for you.

You'll find each of the challenges separaated in ddifferent folders depending on the seniority of the position you are applying to. Each of the folders will contain a README file with speecific details for each of the challenges as well as a specific folder for the mockup/s.

May the code be with you.
